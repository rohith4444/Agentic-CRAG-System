Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Agents/Capstone Project/pinnacle_capstone_data/attention_paper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Agents/Capstone Project/pinnacle_capstone_data/attention_paper.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 15, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20240410211143Z', 'modDate': 'D:20240410211143Z', 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder.

Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input')]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":110}],"source":["response"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":111,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aAm5ERMM2fFL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729981149030,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7312,"user":{"displayName":"Rohith Reddy","userId":"02764363428905860681"}},"outputId":"36943df1-4b02-45cb-a394-be21221dd83e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["---RETRIEVAL FROM VECTOR DB---\n","---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---\n","---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---\n","---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---\n","---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---\n","---DECISION: GENERATE RESPONSE---\n","---GENERATE ANSWER---\n"]}],"source":["query = \"What novel approaches did the Gemini paper introduce in LLM training?\"\n","response = agentic_rag.invoke({\"question\": query})"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":112,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":318},"id":"CTCcEfNx2w-5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729981150343,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":177,"user":{"displayName":"Rohith Reddy","userId":"02764363428905860681"}},"outputId":"437a907f-d014-4b04-e40a-c4befb37aaa9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"The Gemini paper introduced several novel approaches in the training of large language models (LLMs):\n\n1. **Multimodal Training**: The Gemini models are natively multimodal, meaning they are trained jointly across text, image, audio, and video. This approach allows the models to achieve strong capabilities in each domain, setting a new state of the art across a wide range of benchmarks.\n\n2. **Tokenization and Training Strategy**: The number of tokens used to train the largest models was determined following the approach in Hoffmann et al. (2022), while smaller models were trained with significantly more tokens to improve performance for a given inference budget, similar to the approach in Touvron et al. (2023a).\n\n3. **Data Quality and Filtering**: The paper emphasizes the importance of data quality for high-performing models. Quality filters, both heuristic and model-based, were applied to all datasets. Safety filtering was also performed to remove harmful content. The final data mixtures and weights were determined through ablations on smaller models, and training was staged to alter the mixture composition, increasing the weight of domain-relevant data towards the end of training.\n\n4. **Tool Use**: By training LLMs to use tools, the capabilities of the models were greatly expanded beyond their internal knowledge. Tool use was treated as a code generation problem, leveraging the model's strong coding capabilities. This approach allows the model to compose multiple tools in each code block and react to the results of tool execution.\n\nThese approaches collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and capabilities of the Gemini models in various domains."},"metadata":{}}],"source":["display(Markdown(response['generation']))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":106,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0PH45g2E3Dta","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729981114847,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9281,"user":{"displayName":"Rohith Reddy","userId":"02764363428905860681"}},"outputId":"0b844548-9836-403e-b813-80203b1a65e1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["---RETRIEVAL FROM VECTOR DB---\n","---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---\n","---NO DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED---\n","---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---\n","---DECISION: SOME or ALL DOCUMENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO QUESTION, REWRITE QUERY---\n","---REWRITE QUERY---\n","---WEB SEARCH---\n","---WEB SEARCH RESULTS---\n","In this study, we hypothesized that ChatGPT can compose text, tables and figures for a biomedical research paper using two cancer research papers as benchmarks.
